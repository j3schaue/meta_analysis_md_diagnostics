Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},

  abstract = {The ideal of scientific progress is that we accumulate measurements and integrate these into theory, but recent discussion of replicability issues has cast doubt on whether psychological research conforms to this model. Developmental research \textendash{} especially with infant participants \textendash{} also has discipline-specific replicability challenges, including small samples due to high recruitment costs and limited measurement methods. Inspired by collaborative replication efforts in cognitive and social psychology, we describe a proposal for assessing and promoting replicability in infancy research: large-scale, multi-lab replication efforts aiming for a more precise understanding of key developmental phenomena. The ManyBabies project, our instantiation of this proposal, will not only help us estimate how robust and replicable these phenomena are, but also gain new theoretical insights into how they vary across ages, linguistic communities, and measurement methods. This project has the potential for a variety of positive outcomes, including less-biased estimates of theoretically-important effects, estimates of variability that can be used for later study planning, and a series of best-practices blueprints for future infancy research.},

  abstract = {"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

  abstract = {The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis seeks to combine the results of several experiments in order to improve the accuracy of decisions. It is common to use a test for homogeneity to determine if the results of the several experiments are sufficiently similar to warrant their combination into an overall result. Cochran's\hspace{0.6em}Q\hspace{0.6em}statistic is frequently used for this homogeneity test. It is often assumed that\hspace{0.6em}Q\hspace{0.6em}follows a chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis of homogeneity, but it has long been known that this asymptotic distribution for\hspace{0.6em}Q\hspace{0.6em}is not accurate for moderate sample sizes. Here, we present an expansion for the mean of\hspace{0.6em}Q\hspace{0.6em}under the null hypothesis that is valid when the effect and the weight for each study depend on a single parameter, but for which neither normality nor independence of the effect and weight estimators is needed. This expansion represents an order\hspace{0.6em}O(1/n)\hspace{0.6em}correction to the usual chi-square moment in the one-parameter case. We apply the result to the homogeneity test for meta-analyses in which the effects are measured by the standardized mean difference (Cohen's\hspace{0.6em}d-statistic). In this situation, we recommend approximating the null distribution of\hspace{0.6em}Q\hspace{0.6em}by a chi-square distribution with fractional degrees of freedom that are estimated from the data using our expansion for the mean of\hspace{0.6em}Q. The resulting homogeneity test is substantially more accurate than the currently used test. We provide a program available at the Paper Information link at the\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics\hspace{0.6em}website\hspace{0.6em}http://www.biometrics.tibs.org\hspace{0.6em}for making the necessary calculations.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis is used increasingly in the social sciences to synthesize research results. As both primary research and the questions addressed by meta-analysis have been grown more complex, meta-analysis techniques have evolved to address these issues. This book covers a number of advances in meta-analysis that are not covered in detail in many introductory books on research synthesis. More specifically, this book discusses the planning of a meta-analysis for complex questions, computing power for tests in meta-analysis, handling missing data in meta-analysis, integrating individual data into a traditional meta-analysis and generalizing from the results of a meta-analysis. For each topic, a fully annotated example is provided with sample computer programs for the major statistical packages. This book assumes a familiarity with basic meta-analytic techniques. The goal of the book is to provide researchers with advanced strategies for strengthening the planning, conduct and interpretations of meta-analysis with complex data},

  abstract = {Policy analysts involved in quantitative research have many options for
                        handling missing data. The method chosen will often greatly influence the
                        substantive policy conclusions that will be drawn from the data. The most
                        frequent methods for handling missing data assume that the data are missing
                        at random (MAR). The current paper notes that an omnibus, nonparametric test
                        of the MAR assumption is impossible using the observed data alone.
                        Nonetheless various purported tests of the missingness mechanism (including
                        tests of MAR) appear in the literature. The current paper clarifies that all
                        of these tests rely on some assumption that cannot be tested from the data.
                        The paper notes that tests of the missingness mechanism are frequently
                        misinterpreted and it clarifies the appropriate interpretation of such
                        tests. Policy analysts are encouraged not to develop the false impression
                        that modern procedures for handling missing data in conjunction with tests
                        of the missingness mechanism provide protection against the ill effects of
                        missing data. Any justification for a particular approach to handling
                        missing data must be come from substantive knowledge of the missingness
                        process, not from the data.},

  abstract = {For random effects meta-analysis, seven different estimators of the heterogeneity variance are compared and assessed using a simulation study. The seven estimators are the variance component type estimator (VC), the method of moments estimator (MM), the maximum likelihood estimator (ML), the restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML), the empirical Bayes estimator (EB), the model error variance type estimator (MV), and a variation of the MV estimator (MVvc). The performance of the estimators is compared in terms of both bias and mean squared error, using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the REML and especially the ML and MM estimators are not accurate, having large biases unless the true heterogeneity variance is small. The VC estimator tends to overestimate the heterogeneity variance in general, but is quite accurate when the number of studies is large. The MV estimator is not a good estimator when the heterogeneity variance is small to moderate, but it is reasonably accurate when the heterogeneity variance is large. The MVvc estimator is an improved estimator compared to the MV estimator, especially for small to moderate values of the heterogeneity variance. The two estimators MVvc and EB are found to be the most accurate in general, particularly when the heterogeneity variance is moderate to large.

This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with a goal to integrating missing value handling as an integral part of data analysis workflows. New data structures are defined along with new functions (verbs) to perform common operations. Together these provide a cohesive framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods have been made available in the R package `naniar`.},
