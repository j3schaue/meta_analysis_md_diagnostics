This repository contains files relevant for a tutorial on diagnosing missing data issues in a meta-analysis.

- `/code/` contains finalized code to share with the tutorial.
- `/sandbox/` contains code snippets and working scripts that we are testing. Consider the `/sandbox/` directory to be a place for rough drafts of code.
- `/notes/` contains the proposal (and potentially an outline of the paper; forthcoming) for this project.
- `/graphics/` is a directory for storing graphics that we might use in the final paper.
- `/writeup/` is a directory is a place to store writeups of completed results and analyses.
