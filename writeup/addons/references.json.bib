The authors frame the missing-data problem, review methods, offer advice, and raise issues that remain unresolved. They clear up common misunderstandings regarding the missing at random (MAR) concept. They summarize the evidence against older procedures and, with few exceptions, discourage their use. They present, in both technical and practical language, 2 general approaches that come highly recommended: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian multiple imputation (MI). Newer developments are discussed, including some for dealing with missing data that are not MAR. Although not yet in the mainstream, these procedures may eventually extend the ML and MI methods that currently represent the state of the art.},

This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with a goal to integrating missing value handling as an integral part of data analysis workflows. New data structures are defined along with new functions (verbs) to perform common operations. Together these provide a cohesive framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods have been made available in the R package `naniar`.},

  abstract = {Policy analysts involved in quantitative research have many options for
                        handling missing data. The method chosen will often greatly influence the
                        substantive policy conclusions that will be drawn from the data. The most
                        frequent methods for handling missing data assume that the data are missing
                        at random (MAR). The current paper notes that an omnibus, nonparametric test
                        of the MAR assumption is impossible using the observed data alone.
                        Nonetheless various purported tests of the missingness mechanism (including
                        tests of MAR) appear in the literature. The current paper clarifies that all
                        of these tests rely on some assumption that cannot be tested from the data.
                        The paper notes that tests of the missingness mechanism are frequently
                        misinterpreted and it clarifies the appropriate interpretation of such
                        tests. Policy analysts are encouraged not to develop the false impression
                        that modern procedures for handling missing data in conjunction with tests
                        of the missingness mechanism provide protection against the ill effects of
                        missing data. Any justification for a particular approach to handling
                        missing data must be come from substantive knowledge of the missingness
                        process, not from the data.},

  abstract = {Despite the large body of research on missing value distributions and imputation, there is comparatively little literature on how to make it easy to handle, explore, and impute missing values in data. This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with a goal to integrating missing value handling as an integral part of data analysis workflows. New data structures are defined along with new functions (verbs) to perform common operations. Together these provide a cohesive framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods have been made available in the R package `naniar`.},
